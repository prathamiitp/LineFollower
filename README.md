# LineFollower
A simple Code(without the PID controller) for running a line following bot capable of running through broken lines, Uturns, color swapped lines, cross joints and more.
  
* The 6SensorLineFollower file contains the code with proper comments both in [.ino](https://github.com/prathamiitp/LineFollower/blob/master/6SensorLineFollower.ino) and [.txt](https://github.com/prathamiitp/LineFollower/blob/master/6SensorLineFollower.txt) format.
  
* The [Schematic](https://github.com/prathamiitp/LineFollower/blob/master/_images/Schematic.png) gives the basic design idea of chasses for the bot.(I know its childish, but still its beautiful!)

* The [l293d](https://github.com/prathamiitp/LineFollower/blob/master/_images/l293d.png) file gives brief information about the l293d motor driver and its technical specifications.

* Lastly the [line follower circuit](https://github.com/prathamiitp/LineFollower/blob/master/_images/line%20follower%20circuit.png) file gives circuit connections for l293d and IR sensor with arduino.
